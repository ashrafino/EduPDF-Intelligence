# 🎓 Enhanced PDF Scraper with Advanced Organization - Usage Guide

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
Make sure you're in your virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## 🚀 Available Commands

### 1. Run the Comprehensive Demo
See the full organization system in action:
```bash
python demo_organization.py
```
This creates a realistic demo with 19 PDFs showing all organization features.

### 2. Run the Integration Demo
See how the organization integrates with scraping:
```bash
python simple_demo.py
```
This simulates the scraping workflow with automatic organization.

### 3. Check System Status
```bash
python main.py --status
```
Shows current collection status and organization settings.

### 4. Organize Existing PDFs
If you have a folder of PDFs you want to organize:
```bash
python organize_pdfs.py /path/to/your/pdfs -o OrganizedPDFs --recursive
```

### 5. Run Full Scraping with Organization
```bash
python main.py --max-pdfs 10 --organize-immediately
```

## 📁 What Gets Created

After running any organization command, you'll see:

```

## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### Hierarchical Organization
- **Subject Classification**: 21+ subject areas (Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, etc.)
- **Academic Levels**: High School → Undergraduate → Graduate → Postgraduate
- **Topic Categorization**: Specific topics within each subject

### Smart Content Grouping
- **Course Detection**: Automatically groups complete course materials
- **Author Grouping**: Groups materials by the same author
- **Series Recognition**: Identifies multi-part textbooks and documents
- **Related Content**: Groups similar materials by topic and keywords

### Content Discovery
- **Recommendations**: Suggests related materials with similarity scores
- **Series Completion**: Identifies missing parts in document series
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates and prioritizes high-quality content

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive Indexes**: Auto-generated navigation for all content
- **Subject Catalogs**: Detailed listings for each subject area
- **Course Inventories**: Complete course material listings
- **Statistics Reports**: Collection analytics and metrics

## 🔧 Customization

### Organization Settings
The system can be customized by modifying:
- `utils/organization.py` - Add new subjects or topics
- `utils/content_grouping.py` - Adjust grouping algorithms
- `config/settings.py` - Change output directories and parameters

### Adding New Subjects
To add a new subject area, edit the `SubjectArea` enum in `utils/organization.py` and add corresponding taxonomy.

## 📊 Example Output

When you run the demo, you'll see output like:
```
✅ Organization Complete!
📁 Total PDFs Organized: 19
📂 Hierarchical Folders: 10
👥 Content Groups: 14

📈 Subject Distribution:
   Computer Science: 32 PDFs
   Mathematics: 17 PDFs
   Physics: 4 PDFs

🔖 CS101: Introduction to Programming
   Type: course
   Size: 5 PDFs
   Files: syllabus, lectures, assignments, exams

📖 Series: Machine Learning Fundamentals
   Total Parts: 3

```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You know the system is working when you see:
- ✅ Folder structure created with subject/level/topic hierarchy
- ✅ Smart groups created (courses, series, related content)
- ✅ Comprehensive indexes generated
- ✅ Content recommendations working
- ✅ Series detection identifying complete/incomplete sets

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Virtual Environment Issues
Always activate your virtual environment first:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Missing Dependencies
If you get import errors, install missing packages:
```bash
pip install pyyaml aiohttp beautifulsoup4 PyPDF2 pdfplumber
```

### Permission Issues
Make sure you have write permissions to the output directory.
