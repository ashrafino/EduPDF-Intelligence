# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to optimize an existing educational PDF scraper to maximize the collection of high-quality PDFs for high school and university students. The current scraper has basic functionality but needs improvements in data collection efficiency, source diversity, content quality filtering, and scalability to build a comprehensive educational resource database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an educational app developer, I want to maximize PDF collection from diverse academic sources, so that students have access to the largest possible library of educational materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper runs THEN it SHALL collect PDFs from at least 50 different educational sources per subject area
2. WHEN processing each source THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent crawling to discover additional PDF links beyond the initial page
3. WHEN encountering rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry mechanisms
4. IF a source provides an API or sitemap THEN the system SHALL utilize these for more efficient discovery

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want access to high-quality, relevant educational PDFs, so that I can find materials appropriate for my academic level and subject needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading PDFs THEN the system SHALL filter content based on educational relevance using metadata analysis
2. WHEN processing PDFs THEN the system SHALL extract and analyze title, author, institution, and content keywords
3. WHEN categorizing content THEN the system SHALL classify PDFs by academic level (high school, undergraduate, graduate)
4. IF a PDF contains less than 5 pages OR is primarily images THEN the system SHALL skip downloading it
5. WHEN duplicate content is detected THEN the system SHALL keep only the highest quality version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an educational app developer, I want comprehensive metadata for each PDF, so that I can implement effective search and recommendation features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing each PDF THEN the system SHALL extract title, author, subject, academic level, and institution
2. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL generate keyword tags and topic classifications
3. WHEN storing metadata THEN the system SHALL include file quality metrics (page count, text ratio, readability score)
4. WHEN detecting language THEN the system SHALL automatically classify PDFs by language with confidence scores
5. IF OCR is needed for scanned PDFs THEN the system SHALL extract text and store searchable content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the scraper to be resilient and efficient, so that it can run continuously without manual intervention and handle large-scale operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering network errors THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN processing large numbers of files THEN the system SHALL use parallel processing to improve throughput
3. WHEN running for extended periods THEN the system SHALL implement checkpoint/resume functionality
4. IF memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection and memory optimization
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and continue processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an educational app developer, I want to expand source coverage beyond current limitations, so that I can access the maximum variety of educational content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN discovering new sources THEN the system SHALL support additional academic repositories (arXiv, ResearchGate, institutional repositories)
2. WHEN processing different site structures THEN the system SHALL implement adaptive scraping strategies
3. WHEN encountering JavaScript-heavy sites THEN the system SHALL use browser automation for dynamic content
4. IF RSS feeds or APIs are available THEN the system SHALL integrate these for more efficient content discovery
5. WHEN processing international sources THEN the system SHALL handle multiple languages and character encodings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an educational app developer, I want intelligent content organization and deduplication, so that the PDF library is well-structured and free of redundant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing PDFs THEN the system SHALL create hierarchical categories (subject > level > topic)
2. WHEN detecting duplicates THEN the system SHALL use content hashing and similarity analysis
3. WHEN multiple versions exist THEN the system SHALL keep the most recent or highest quality version
4. IF similar content is found THEN the system SHALL group related materials together
5. WHEN categorizing content THEN the system SHALL use machine learning for automatic classification
